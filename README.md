# Dog-Bot
-----

Dog Bot is a simple and open-source bot written in Lua that uses the Discordia library.

Before using this, some important prerequisites: 
 - If you intend to add more images, ensure that you attribute the creator. You don't have to do this if it's public domain or CC0.
 - Change the code so that it includes your bot's Token. Otherwise, it will not work.
 - This bot uses Discordia, which you should install before using this code.
